git status - helps us to determine what is the status of the directory

rm -rf .git - this command makes the git directory back to a local directory

git init - this will make the local directory to a git directory

how will you track your project files?
you have to add them
1. You can add all the files together (when we do for the 1st time)
2. You can choose to add specific file(s)

git add -A  [this will add all the files]
git add --a [this will add all the files too]

once everything is added, then you need to commit

git commit -m "pushing the files for the first time"
git remote add origin git@github.com:sarthakkumarpanda/LearningGitJan2025.git
git push -u origin master

git add .  [this command will only add the modified file(s)]
